            <h4>Thai Soup</h4>
            <p>Authentic, bold, and delicious Thai flavors make this soup irresistible! This is the best Thai coconut soup I've had. You won't be disappointed with this one! Serve over steamed rice.Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir the ginger, lemongrass, and curry paste in the heated oil for 1 minute. Slowly pour the chicken broth over the mixture, stirring continually. Stir in the fish sauce and brown sugar; simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in the coconut milk and mushrooms; cook and stir until the mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes.</p>

Boil 2 eggs for 8 minutes then shell and halve.Toss the beans, potatoes and remaining salad ingredients, except the eggs, together in a large bowl with half the dressing.

            <h4>Healthy dish</h4>
            <p>Freshly chopped veggies meet the wonderfully versatile naan bread in this easy, incredibly customizable recipe. This recipe can easily feed four people, but if it's the only thing for lunch, then the number of servings is definitely two. Hope you enjoy it!Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place naan on baking sheets and brush with olive oil.Bake naan in the preheated oven until light toasted, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
